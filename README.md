Rozvoz jidla public API

Provides info about food delivery based on location.
Stores polygons of delivery ares. Based on user's GPS location, it returns matched delivery areas.
Idea behind it: 
There are different delivery services, but to aggregator of them, so it's unclear what services you can get and people are leaving their home and visit shops even they don't have to.
This should return available services based on your location and delivery service areas.
It need some manual work to get polygons from all providers, like rohlik.cz, or itesco.cz,
